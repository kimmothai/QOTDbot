# QOTDbot
Quote Of The Day bot. A Discord bot that provides motivation and/or laughs

# Motivation
My goal was to learn how Discord API is used. Also, I have wanted to use the Games Done Quick message generator in a personal project for some time now.

# How it works
The bot listens to a channel in my Discord and returns a relevant message based on the command. The commands can be configured in config.py.

# Build status
1.0.0 and is used in my private Discord.

# Tech
* Python
* Discord messaging software
* Discord API
* Taskinoz's GDQ API
